                <h2>experts</h2>
                <p>My sister, who works as a graphic designer, as well as a cousin who works in a similar industry, were both shown my
                current game on. They have been in the real industry for many years than I have even been in college, so I felt that
                they were qualified to give me advice. I asked them, what could be added to this project, aside from an overhaul of
                code, that would make it more engaging and visually interesting?
                </p>

                <h2>critique</h2>
                <p>They mentioned that my art is easily the strongest part, and to keep in the same direction for any other elements that
                would be added. My sister stressed that the current animation style is something to maintain through the final project.
                They all mentioned that readability was an issue, and could be helped with a darker, different background. On top of
                that, they agreed that some type of transition, whether a fade in/cut out/slide in would help tie in the project,
                especially since I told them that I planned on adding a bit more to the project. For example, they said that the map I
                would add could be animated when hovered or clicked on, ideally with visual indicators. They mentioned the Pok√©mon in
                game map as a reference point. Sound was also a suggestion, as sound could really help tie in the animations seen
                throughout the game, as well as establishing setting more effectively.
