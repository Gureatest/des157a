                <h2>project summary</h2>
                <p>The project I am planning on expanding is the Game On! project. I plan to visually improve these
                    elements in functionality, as well the pure length of the game. I plan on adding more mechanical
                    elements in the game, as well as some more visual designs that aid in the visual appeal of the game.
                </p>

                <h2>project description</h2>
                <p>I currently plan on improving the battle game itself, as currently it is very bare bones like the template that was
                given. I also do plan on adding more mechanics regarding the rollercoaster theme itself, as I feel that there is much
                opportunity to be mechanically interesting regarding the subject. Mechanics such as picking moves, a run mechanic, or
                even just rehashing the whole battle experience entirely into a platformer would all be options for improvement. I also
                aim to improve the visual design in ways that pique more visual interest. Improving the existing art or adding
                animations onto some elements will be methods that allow more interesting visuals and interactivity. The ability to use
                JavaScript for triggered animations will also allow for a more engaging game experience.
                </p>

                <h2>expert feedback</h2>
                <p>For functionality, I do plan to reach out to graduate CS students within close family and friends, as I can name a
                couple people off the top of my head. For the visual design, I may plan to the reach out to Skye, our undergrad tutor,
                and again, more people within my family. I may ask around within my circle just for general feedback as well.
                </p>
