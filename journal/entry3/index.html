                <h2>journal post 3</h2>
                <p class="date">date: october 25rd, 2023</p>
                <p>This article has reminded me of the new-age skill of media literacy. People don’t take it seriously,
                    but as I see more
                    and more people fall for the lamest attempts at propaganda it seriously irks me. The examples they
                    use are photos of
                    journalists photographing serious events that affect livelihood. The article makes great points,
                    about how images make
                    us think more about the world and what happens around us.</p>

                <p> This makes it even more important that people should not look away. Derailing from the purpose of
                    the article, photos
                    they show are meant to make people uncomfortable, and photography or visuals are so important in
                    practicing empathy and
                    understanding emotional responses. The analysis they use for these photos is very valuable, because
                    they show a
                    conclusion of the failures of society, whether corruption, colonialism, warfare, etc.</p>

                <p> I feel like this is even more relevant as media keeps desensitizing us more, whether through the
                    dehumanization of
                    people through statistics or equating a visual with something else entirely. Being able to garner an
                    emotion from
                    imagery is a powerful skill nowadays, and its obvious that many people have lost or lack this skill
                </p>
