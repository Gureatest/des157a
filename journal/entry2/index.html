                <h2>journal post 2</h2>
                <p class="date">date: october 23rd, 2023</p>
                <p>As someone who uses a variety of services across several different platforms, nothing irks me more
                    than a poor overlay.
                    Whether it’s because it takes up to much space, distracts from the flow of using the app, or just
                    has awful interactable
                    objects such as closing buttons, poor overlays drastically reduce the enjoyment of a service.</p>

                <p> The examples shown in the article are egregious, but it’s obvious that the authors sentiment does
                    not come out of
                    nowhere. I generally find overlays really annoying, especially in a time when web design is much
                    easier to perform than
                    before. Obviously, the article being from 2015 means that these types of websites are much rarer as
                    people have learned
                    the basics of web design. However, the points the author brings up can be applied to things beyond
                    overlays..</p>

                <p> Ideas such as how overlays should be user initiated can be applied to quite literally any element in
                    web design. If you
                    didn’t set it off, why is it there? If you do cause something to appear, is it visible to the user?
                    Just asking simple
                    questions when designing can avoid many of these flaws of web design. </p>
