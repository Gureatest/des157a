                <h2>journal post 1</h2>
                <p class="date">date: october 19th, 2023</p>
                <p>I think that usability should be a stronger focus for web and app designers. Even looking at the UC
                    Davis Parking app,
                    AMP Park, has awful UI, is basically unusable, and the ratings on the app page rave about how
                    unusable and awful it is.
                    A frustrating design can literally make or break a design and prevent a user from interacting with
                    it at all depending
                    on how patient they are. At a certain point it becomes less about speed and more about willingness
                    to participate.</p>

                <p> An interesting piece was the placeholder text, and how it often hurts usability, but seeing the
                    reasoning, particularly
                    memory, it does make much more sense. Many of these practices are very reasonable, understandable
                    advice and is
                    something that I think we seem to take for granted.</p>

                <p> A good example of these practices would be any food delivery app, particularly Door Dash, Postmates,
                    and the like. These
                    apps are the definition of usability and ease of use, as their entire marketing relies on these
                    concepts. They are made
                    for one platform, making it easier to design, and they arenâ€™t afraid to sacrifice aesthetics for
                    usability. </p>
